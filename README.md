# Image Processing Pipeline

This program focuses on image processing and visualization, primarily preparing images for input into deep learning models like MobileNet.

It utilizes libraries such as OpenCV and PIL for reading and resizing images, ensuring they are in the appropriate format for neural network consumption. 
The code reads an image file, resizes it to 224x224 pixels, and converts the color format from BGR to RGB for proper display. By loading the MobileNet model, the program sets the stage for potential image classification or feature extraction tasks. 

Overall, it provides a foundation for further exploration in computer vision applications.
